            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I study Computer Science and Math at the National University of Singapore.</p>
            <p>I'm fairly new to programming, but I have found an interest in systems, networks, functional programming, and computer graphics. I'm also interested in mathematics and philosophy, as well as reading <a href="books.html">novels</a>. Recently, I've been trying to learn Esperanto.</p>
            <p>My favorite programming languages are Zig and Go, and I primarily use Neovim. I've lately gained an interest in Linux, and I switch between Fedora and MacOS on my laptop. I also enjoy tinkering with my system configuration. You can find my dotfiles <a href="https://github.com/Reshiro/dotfiles" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <p>I enjoy listening to high-fidelity music, and occasionally participate in audiophile events in Singapore. My other interests include mechanical keyboards and gaming mouse modifications.</p>
            <p>I currently use an HHKB as my daily driver, and use both the QWERTY and <a href="https://github.com/rdavison/graphite-layout" target="_blank">Graphite</a> keyboard layouts.</p>
